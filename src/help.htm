        <h2 id="does_FastDeer_automatically_convert_audio_into_text">Does FastDeer automatically convert audio into text?</h2>

        <p>No, it doesn’t. FastDeer is designed to make the manual task of transcribing audio a little less painful.</p>

        <h2 id="something_changed">Something used to work, but now it’s broken!</h2>
        
        <p>A big update in January 2017 may have broken existing functionality. If something has stopped working for you, please temporarily switch to <a href="http://FastDeer.com/classic/">FastDeer Classic</a> and let me know of the problem by tweeting at <a href="http://twitter.com/FastDeer">@FastDeer</a>.</p>
        
        <h2 id="my_audio_file_doesn8217t_work">My audio file doesn&#8217;t work!</h2>

        <p>Try the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Convert your file to WAV or MP3 format with <a href="http://media.io/">media.io</a>. (This is an external service and is not affiliated with FastDeer.)</li>
        <li>Try a different web browser. FastDeer works best on Chrome 31+ and Safari 7+.</li>
        <li>Still no luck? You can contact me directly at <a href="mailto:FastDeer@elliotbentley.com">FastDeer@elliotbentley.com</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="where_is_my_transcript_stored_how_secure_is_it">Where is my transcript stored? How secure is it?</h2>

        <p>FastDeer is designed in a way that your data (both the audio file and the written transcript) <em>never</em> leaves your local computer. The transcript is not kept on a remote server or &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;, but is instead in the browser&#8217;s <em>localStorage</em>. The downside is that it is not possible to access your saved transcripts from another computer.</p>

    <p>FastDeer's automatic backup system saves the current transcript every five minutes. Click on the <i class="fa fa-history"></i> button to view backups and restore an old copy of your transcript. Exactly 100 copies are retained; once the 100 backup limit is reached, FastDeer will erase older copies.</p>
    
    <p>FastDeer is not a permanent document store, as browser storage is notoriously unreliable (even with this backup system). Please make sure to export your work regularly to prevent loss of data.</p>

    <h2 id="my_transcript_disappeared_can_i_get_it_back">My transcript has disappeared, can I get it back?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is: unfortunately, no.</p>
    
    <p>The long answer is: FastDeer sometimes loses work for a multitude of reasons (including the user clearing their cache or localStorage becoming full). If your work is not present in the history panel, it's gone for good. Please make sure to export your work regularly, especially when using FastDeer for an extended period of time.</p>
    
    <h2 id="why_is_FastDeer_is_no_longer_saving_backups">Why is FastDeer is no longer saving backups?</h2>
        
    <p>This can sometimes happen when the browser's local storage is full. If you clear the existing stored documents, it should begin saving again. Note that this may affect locally-stored data belonging to other apps and sites.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong> Google Chrome</strong>: Go to “Clear Browsing Data” in Chrome’s "More tools" menu and check “Hosted app data” only. Then press "Clear browsing data".</li>
    <li><strong>Firefox</strong>: Open <a href="about:preferences#privacy">preferences</a> and go to "privacy". Click on "clear your recent history" and check "cookies" only. Then click "clear now".</li>
    <li><strong>Safari</strong>: Open Safari preferences and go to the "Privacy" tab. Click on the small "Details..." button. Search for FastDeer, then click on the FastDeer row and click "Remove".</li>
    <li>Alternatively, if you know how to access the browser console, you can run <strong>localStorage.clear();</strong> on FastDeer.com.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="what_keyboard_shortcuts_are_there">What keyboard shortcuts are there?</h2>

    <h3 id="audio_playback">Audio playback</h3>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Esc</strong>: Play/pause</li>
    <li><strong>F1</strong> (or <strong>Ctrl+1</strong>): Rewind</li>
    <li><strong>F2</strong> (or <strong>Ctrl+2</strong>): Fast-forward</li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong> (or <strong>Ctrl+3</strong>): Slow down</li>
    <li><strong>F4</strong> (or <strong>Ctrl+4</strong>): Speed up</li>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+K</strong>: Jump to time (brings up window)</li>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+0</strong>: Return to start</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="text_editing">Text editing</h3>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+B</strong>: Bold</li>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+I</strong>: Italic</li>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+U</strong>: Underline</li>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+J</strong>: Insert timestamp</li>
    <li><strong>Ctrl+S</strong>: Manual backup</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: On OS X, use Cmd instead of Ctrl.</p>
    
    <h2 id="custom_keyboard_shortcuts">How can I set custom keyboard shortcuts?</h2>

    <p>Open settings (<i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i>) to access custom keyboard shortcuts. To add a new shortcut, click the blue “+” next to the name of the function you want to add a keyboard shortcut for, and then press a key combination. To remove a shortcut, click the <i class="fa fa-times"></i> next to the shortcut you want to remove. Note that you may need to refresh the page to clear the old shortcuts.</p>

    <h2 id="what_audio_formats_does_FastDeer_support">What audio formats does FastDeer support?</h2>

    <p>FastDeer is limited by the formats supported by each individual browser. The formats supported by your own browser will be listed below the &#8220;Choose audio file&#8221; button. In general, WAV files are widely supported, and MP3 files mostly work on everything except Mozilla Firefox. Certain video files, as well as YouTube videos, are also supported.</p>

    <h2 id="how_do_the_interactive_timestamps_work">How do the interactive timestamps work?</h2>

    <p>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+J</strong> (<strong>Cmd+J</strong> on OS X) will insert the audio file&#8217;s current time into the document. This timestamp is hyperlinked and will skip to the specific time in the audio file.</p>

    <h2 id="can_i_use_FastDeer_offline">Can I use FastDeer offline?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes! FastDeer.com will automatically save an offline copy of itself in your browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache">HTML5 Application Cache</a> when you load up the page for the first time. To use the offline version, simply go to FastDeer.com without an internet connection. It's that simple.</p>
    <p>Note that buttons will look different when offline and some features like YouTube support and Google Drive export will not work.</p>
            
    <h2 id="why_cant_i_change_the_speed_of_a_youtube_video">Why can't I change the speed of a YouTube video?</h2>

    <p>Some YouTube videos simply don't support it. This isn't something FastDeer has any control over, unfortunately.</p>


    <h2 id="how_do_i_import_and_export_my_transcript">How do I import and export my transcript?</h2>

    <p>FastDeer can only import one type of file, the .OTR FastDeer file format. This format preserves the clickable time stamps.</p>
    
    <p>Open the export panel by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> button. You can export .OTR files, along with plain text (.txt) and Markdown (.md) files.</p>


    <h2 id="can_i_automatically_open_a_youtube_video_based_on_a_query_parameter">Can I automatically open a YouTube video based on a query parameter?</h2>

    <p>Yes! Thanks to contributor <a href="https://github.com/kostasx">Kostas Minaidis</a>, it’s possible to have FastDeer automatically open a video on load. To do so, you'll need to append a query parameter (v=YOUTUBE_ID) to FastDeer.com. Like so:</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://FastDeer.com/?v=VrMHA3yX_QI">http://FastDeer.com/?v=VrMHA3yX_QI</a></p>    
    
    <p>You an also open a video at a specific timeframe using a second query parameter (t=SECONDS or t=HH:MM:SS).</p>

    <p>Automatic loading of a video on a specific point in time using seconds notation: <a href="http://FastDeer.com/?v=VrMHA3yX_QI&t=506">http://FastDeer.com/?v=VrMHA3yX_QI&t=506</a></p>

    <p>Automatic loading of a video on a specific point in time using HH:MM:SS notation: <a href="http://FastDeer.com/?v=VrMHA3yX_QI&t=45:54">http://FastDeer.com/?v=VrMHA3yX_QI&t=45:54</a></p>

    <p>Translations have been provided by over a dozen <a href="https://github.com/FastDeer/FastDeer/#translations">talented and generous volunteers</a>.</p>
